    "text": "Welcome to the blog of the nephroepidemiology group at the UMC Utrecht! Here, we will share interesting publications (both from our own group and from other researchers), give updates on conferences we attended, and share posts aimed at laymen (written in understandable Dutch).\nTo kick things off, today, we had our first get together. Although the nephroepidemiology group has existed for a longer time, this was given shape in an informal manner. Today marks the first occurrence of our biweekly recurring meeting. These meetings will serve not only as a short moment to connect with each other, but also to discuss currently ongoing projects, discuss articles, give talks, host external speakers, etc.\n…\nTo finish off, I’ll append an R trick to each post (until I run out of tricks)\n\nThis post’s R-trick: multicursor\nDid you know you can activate a multicursor in R? This allows you to write the same code on multiple lines simultaneously. Great for if you are writing code in bulk! To activate it, simply hold the Alt/Option key and drag the cursor along the lines that you want the cursor to apply to. On some operating systems, you may need to press the Alt/Option key one more time to activate the cursor. Happy bulk-writing!\nAn example from Stackoverflow \n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Hi! Welcome to the homepage of the nephroepidemiology research group of the University Medical Center (UMC) Utrecht.\n\nOur team is diverse in its background and specialties, but all members share the same mission: improving clinical care and outcomes for individuals with chronic kidney disease, those on dialysis, and kidney transplant recipients, using epidemiological methods and big data.\nTo this end, we use advanced epidemiological and data scientific methods, applied to a wide range of large and granular data sources, including randomised controlled trials, cohort studies, electronic health records, and registries.\nWe are located at the UMC Utrecht. Our team is embedded in the Department of Nephrology and Hypertension and in Utrecht Patient Oriented Database (UPOD) of the Central Diagnostics Laboratory.\n\n\n\n\n\nUMC Utrecht\n\n\nThis collaboration gives us access both to direct clinical involvement and to the high-quality research infrastructure of UPOD.\nWant to know more? Check out our currently running projects and previous output.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

Vernooij\nORCID: 0000-0001-5734-4566\nRobin is an assistant professor at the UMC Utrecht, and spearheads this research group. He received his PhD on improving guideline methodology and reporting from the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (Spain). Having previously worked at Cochrane and the Dutch Cancer Registry, and currently working as epidemiologist at the Dutch Kidney Registry, Robin’s academic work is strengthened by ample experience in registry research and evidence synthesis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoemer J. Janse\nORCID: 0000-0003-0059-872X\nRoemer is a clinical epidemiologist, working on the interplay of nephrology, immunology, and virology in kidney transplantation recipients. He completed his BSc in Medicine and afterwards finished his PhD on causal inference and prediction modelling in people with CKD, at the Leiden University Medical Center (The Netherlands) and Karolinska Institutet (Sweden). Besides his clinical projects, he provides epidemiological and programming support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCindy P. Porras\nORCID: 0000-0001-7692-9164\nCindy is a medical doctor and clinical epidemiologist, applying her knowledge to the cardiorenal axis. She performed multiple studies on sex differences in peripheral arterial disease and is currently investigating heart failure and its interplay with kidney disease. Her thesis also has a methodological component, with a specific focus on prediction modelling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJulia M.T. Colombijn\nORCID: 0000-0002-9022-5937\nJulia is a PhD student currently finishing her medical studies. Her PhD research focuses on polypharmacy in individuals with chronic kidney disease. Besides elucidating the extent of polypharmacy in this population, she has also studied the lack of evidence for multiple common cardiorenal protective drugs and has further investigated their use in this population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDenise M.J. Veltkamp\nORCID: 0000-0001-9914-7827\nDenise is a medical doctor whose research focuses on long-term outcomes after acute kidney injury. To get a broad overview, she has performed multiple meta-analyses and clustering studies, and worked on developing prediction models to get personalised insights in these long-term outcomes. Additionally, she has previously done research on the patient perspective in kidney transplantation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSanne Roos\nORCID: 0009-0004-7225-8542\nSanne is a medical doctor, doing her PhD on haemodiafiltration. Not only is she investigating the possible mechanisms through which haemodiafiltraiton improves survival; she is also working to assess the effect of haemodiafiltration in a real-world population and obtain individualised estimates of its effect over haemodialysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEllis Oortwijn\nORCID: 0009-0004-5917-8716\nEllis is a PhD student with a background in cardiovascular health and disease. Bringing with her experience in both fundamental and clinical research, she now focuses on the utilisation, safety, and effectiveness of cardiovascular risk management in individuals with chronic kidney disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
